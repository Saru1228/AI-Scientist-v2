        "Short Hypothesis": "Environmental variability significantly influences the emergent behavior and decision-making processes in insect swarms.",
        "Related Work": "Existing studies have primarily focused on collective behavior and decision-making in insect swarms using idealized conditions. This proposal distinguishes itself by integrating environmental perturbations, enhancing the understanding of how swarms adapt to real-world conditions.",
        "Abstract": "This research aims to investigate the impact of environmental variability on the collective behavior of insect swarms, utilizing three-dimensional trajectory data of Chironomus riparius swarms recorded at 100 Hz. By systematically introducing controlled environmental factors\u2014such as varying light conditions, noise levels, and spatial constraints\u2014we will analyze changes in individual and collective kinematics, interactions, and decision-making processes. The study will employ an individual-based model (IBM) calibrated with empirical data to simulate swarm dynamics under varying conditions. Key metrics, including swarm cohesion, density profiles, and trajectory persistence, will be assessed to quantify the effects of environmental perturbations. By bridging empirical observations with computational modeling, this work aims to provide insights into the adaptive strategies of swarms in response to fluctuating environments, ultimately contributing to the fields of bio-inspired robotics and optimization algorithms.",
